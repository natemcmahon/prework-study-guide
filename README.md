# prework-study-guide

## Description

A study guide for course pre work. This provides me a place to take notes on the four main topics of the course pre work: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. This is the first website I've created. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

No installation required, just run it locally

## Usage

In order to add notes, just type in the HTML file within li elements. Then you'll need to save the file and push your code up to your remote repository. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
